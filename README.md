An AI-assisted number guess game is an easy Python code where the computer picks a number at random from 1 to 100 and the user guesses it. The code gives a hint such as "too high" or "too low" following each guess to assist the player. The game counts how many attempts there have been and prints the ultimate outcome when the correct number has been guessed.

Most important elements of the game:
✅ Generation of random numbers with the random module.
✅ Handling of user input to accept guesses.
✅ Hint system to assist the player.
✅ Error handling to ensure only valid inputs are allowed.
✅ Looping mechanism to allow the game to proceed until the number is correctly guessed.

This is an excellent beginner-level Python project to learn loops, conditionals, functions, and exception handling. ????
